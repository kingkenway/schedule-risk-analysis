# Schedule Risk Analysis
Final Year Research Project: Development of a Web Based Software for Schedule Risk Analysis In Project Management

# Abstract

Schedule Risk Analysis in project management is a technique with numerous research efforts
to distinguish between risky and less risky activities, across various project activities. In this
research, a Graphic User Interface (GUI) was developed to the increase efficiency of the
computation process of Project Schedule Risk Management techniques.

Six (6) standardized sensitivity measures were identified and computed. The considered
measures are the Criticality Index (CI), Schedule Sensitivity Index (SSI), Significance Index
(SI), Pearson Cruciality Index, Kendall’s Tau Cruciality Index and Spearman’s Cruciality
Index.
The sensitivity measures are based on the number of Monte Carlos Simulation,
duration of the project activities, the activities predecessors, the simulated activity duration
alongside, with the simulated project duration. A Graphic User Interface (GUI) with the six
measures embedded, was developed for the Schedule risk analysis, using PHP language and
Javascript.

The results obtained from the computational analysis, with the Critical Index (CI) been the
primary from the Graphical User Interface, showed that five activities out of 10 which are B,
C, D, E and J, are the less risky activities. The graphs generated can be used to steer the
project control process during project process.

In Schedule Risk Analysis, the development of the various sensitivity measures is required,
so as reflect a possible real project scenario where unexpected changes to the activity may
occur.
